# Project 1
This is the books web application.
I have implemented register , login and logout.
Once the user has logged in , the will be able to search for a book via the isbn or the title or the author. Even if they do not enter the details completely , similar results will be shown.
The details page gives the details about the book along with reviews and ratings from the user.
It also contains rating and number of ratings from goodreads.
And lastly the api/<isbn> route will give the details of the book in json format.
